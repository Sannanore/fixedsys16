# Fixedsys (16)
Font used in fallout games and MUSHclient now usable with windows console! Doesn't require any funky regex edits to install, just double click it, then select it in your console application and set size to 16.
The font was originally authored by Darien Valentine @bathos and provided via a now-defunct site at fixedsysexcelsior.com, but was not selectable in windows console because it was lacking Panose monospace definition.
